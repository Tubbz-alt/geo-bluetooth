TODO
x - update README.md with couch instructions
x - format objects w/ property names for RMC & GSV types
x - get sentences as a packet instead of one-by-one
x - buffer incoming data every 30 sec. (w/option to change interval)
x - make UI setting for changing interval
x - show the interval value on connect
x - stop BT logging when connecting to couch
x - convert the NMEA timestamp to human-readable 
x - RE-DO: progress wheel when connecting to couch -- don't take over screen
x - show/hide config forms
x - move nmea parse code out of openPort()
x - clean up handling of messages in status bar, esp wrt showing that connection stopped b/c of DB
? - should it reconnect to BT once couch sync is done? (Code to do that isn't working currently)
x - give message when sentences are recorded to local (pouch, not couch) ?? eg, "Last recorded at 10:23"
? - maybe instead of disconnecting from BT, just prevent saving to DB
- (minor) collapse config form again on save <-- buggy. putting aside for now
x - fix db error msg
? - use form tags so that "Go" button on keyboard will work (?? + make button submit type?)
x - check/correct trailing slash on server IP (http check would be good too)
- Show number of records on device and number that were stored in last save to Couch


== extra: ==
!! UPDATE creating new database DOES work! If the db doesn't exist, couch/pouch creates it. So you can use the app w/o first creating a couch db.

== Notes ==
other sentence types from the GLO, besides RMC and GSV:
GGA, VTG, GSA
