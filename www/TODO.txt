x - update README.md with couch instructions
x - format objects w/ property names for RMC & GSV types
x - get sentences as a packet instead of one-by-one
x - buffer incoming data every 30 sec. (w/option to change interval)
x - make UI setting for changing interval
x - show the interval value on connect
x - stop BT logging when connecting to couch
x - convert the NMEA timestamp to human-readable 
x - RE-DO: progress wheel when connecting to couch -- don't take over screen
x - show/hide config forms
x - move nmea parse code out of openPort()
x - clean up handling of messages in status bar, esp wrt showing that connection stopped b/c of DB
x - After Couch save is done, start storing data to local again.
x - give message when sentences are recorded to local (pouch, not couch) ?? eg, "Last recorded at 10:23"
x - instead of disconnecting from BT, just prevent saving to DB
x - fix db error msg
? - (low priority) use form tags so that "Go" button on keyboard will work (BUT without the button sending new request w/ "submit") 
x - check/correct trailing slash on server IP (http check would be good too)

- Show number of records on device and number that were stored in last save to Couch: 
	"Last saved to 123.123.42/dbname at 06/12/2014 12:22" 
	"100 records on this device"
	"30 records not yet saved to server" (and/or "70/100 records saved to server")
  ** show total number of records in CouchDB! (to last connected database & server) ****

? - Pause/clear display ... did we decide against this in favor of also showing records as they are saved every n seconds?

todo notes, jun 28:
- move all couch connection messages to bottom next to button? (ie, remove from top status?)
- show total number of records in last connected remote database


== extra: ==
!! UPDATE creating new database DOES work! If the db doesn't exist, couch/pouch creates it. So you can use the app w/o first creating a couch db.

== Notes ==
other sentence types from the GLO, besides RMC and GSV:
GGA, VTG, GSA
