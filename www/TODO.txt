- should it reconnect to BT once couch sync is done? (Code to do that isn't working currently)
- give message as sentences are recorded to local (pouch, not couch) ?? eg, "Last recorded at 10:23"



== extra: ==
- create a new db in remote couch from phonegap? Pouch does not allow this. However, it could be done via CouchDB's REST interface directly. 
		For example, if you run:
			curl -X PUT http://127.0.0.1:5984/albums 
		and the database 'albums' already exists, you will get this error:
			{"error":"file_exists","reason":"The database could not be created, the file already exists."}
		otherwise, it will be created
